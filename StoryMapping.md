# Project User Story Mapping: Asteroids
 BHAG	You’re part of the crew in a rocketship, trying to survive in the asteroid belt by shooting and avoiding asteroids as well as alien invaders.
 Narrative driven user stories
### Notes
* Ship, Asteroid, Alien, Space, Projectile
* Input Model, Game Model
* Initialization -> game loop -> deinitialization
	* As the player, I want to be able to control my ship (rotating, moving forward, shooting bullets) so that I can avoid asteroids and invaders.
	* As the player, I want to be able to shoot the asteroids and alien’s attack.
	* As the player, I should be incentivized to destroy asteroids and aliens.
	* As the player, I should have several tries in my endeavors. (Multiple lives)
	* As the asteroid, I float in the space to act as an obstacle to the ship.
	* As the asteroid, I can collide with the ship.
	* As the alien, I can move from left to right, or up and down to avoid alien’s attacks.
	* As the alien, I want to shoot the ship.
	* As space, I want to contain the player (ship), asteroids, and aliens
	* As a projectile, I want to hit stuff, depending on who shot me.
